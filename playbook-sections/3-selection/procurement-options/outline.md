## 8(a) Directed Award

Agencies want to get started with blockchain quickly, but there are a number of procurement issues that typically get in the way:
* Competitive Procurements: The competitive buying process is long
* Prescriptive Work: Government prescribes the solution, which forbids vendors’ innovative approaches
* Requirements Gathering: Government’s needs document (aka requirements) are lengthy and therefore written at a crawling pace

For decades the 8(a) direct award procurement authority (FAR Subpart 19.8) has been helped agencies buy faster and simpler.  Compared to most ways to buy for the federal government, using the 8(a) authority allows agencies to buy more like how it is done in private industry:

* Go to the vendor you want without competing it: As long as it with an 8(a) vendor, and the contract is under $4M
* First talk with vendor, then iron out the details: Engage with vendor first, then define scope and/or pricing format collaboratively
* No long essay about why you chose the vendor: Just a brief 1 or 2-page evaluation will do; no sole source justification needed

However, SBA’s regulations dictate that when a procurement is awarded as an 8(a) contract, its follow-on or renewable acquisition must also be awarded as an 8(a) contract unless SBA agrees to release the requirement for non-8(a) competition.  Therefore the 8(a) Program Digital Service Initiative was created to provide additiional flexibilities for agencies that want to leverage the 8(a) program to get started with digital services (including blockchain).

* Pre-established Statements of Objectives
    * Learning digital services
    * Trying new modern technology stacks
    * Developing a minimally viable product
* Generally not for
    * Fully system/solution implementation
    * Operations and maintenance efforts
    * Other non-included services (ie. content strategy, data architecture and migration, etc.)
* How to use the SBA's 8(a) exemption:
    * Determine if the project’s needs can be met with a non-competitive, direct award procurement contract under $4 million.
    * Determine if the project qualifies for the initiative. Review the SOOs to find the scope most appropriate for your program.
    * Identify capable 8(a) vendors (this may include vendors with valid GSA Stars II contracts.)
    * Proceed through the normal procurement process per FAR 19.8. (Note: If using GSA stars II, follow GSA’s ordering guide.)
    * Send the SBA memo, dated December 20, 2016, to your agency’s Off ice of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) along with the RFP, or other associated or contract documents with one of the SOO’s incorporated.
* At the end of the contract:
    * Keep any follow-on work within the 8(a) program or switch to another contracting method or vehicle without getting SBA or OSDBU approval for removal from 8(a) program.

With regard to finding quickly finding 8(a) vendors that are strong at digital services, an agency should consider hosting a match-making industry day as described in the following case study (this is currently being drafted so there is no link yet).
